# PerfectSchedule

Does your team user PagerDuty? Do you waste time every month swapping shifts to work around vacations, balance out holidays, and ensure fairness? Then PerfectSchedule is for you!

PerfectSchedule fetches avaiability constraints from Outlook & Google Calendars, generates an optimal, fair schedule, and publishes the result back to PagerDuty.

Never think about on-call swaps ever again!
